EBI-10043724	CST complex	RPA-like (replication protein A) complex, that has high affinity for telomeric ssDNA. The complex is assembled during late S-G2 and is involved in capping, and thus protecting, single stranded telomeric DNA and preventing chromosomal damage by inhibiting telomerase activity. Plays a role in the regulation of the synthesis of C strand via its interaction with polymerase alpha primase.	Stn1 interacts with the other 2 subunits, forming a bridge between them. Stn1 and Ten1 can form a heterodimer and Cdc13 on its own, has the ability to form a homodimer. 	CDC13:STN1:TEN1	YDL220C	Cdc13p

EBI-10047180	Replication protein A complex	Single-stranded DNA binding protein complex involved in all processes that involve single-stranded (ss)DNA by binding to and protecting exposed ssDNA from nucleases. Forms a physical platform to recruit other factors to the DNA including those involved in DNA damage signaling, DNA repair, and DNA replication.  RPA protects against inappropriate telomere recombination, and upon telomere uncapping, prevents cell proliferation by a checkpoint-independent pathway. RPA prevents degradation of ssDNA and prevents formation of secondary structures.	RPA can associate with ssDNA in different modalities; a low affinity mode which binds 8?12 nucleotides (nts) and a high-affinity compact mode involving four major DBDs from RFA1 and RFA2 that bends a 28 nts ssDNA tract into a horse-shoe shaped configuration. RFA33 is thought to provide a structural role within the complex. Multiple RPAs may assemble on ssDNA and form higher order assemblies that modulate its function.	RFA1:RFA2:RFA3	YAR007C	Rfa1p

Sm proteins contain an N-terminal alpha-helix followed by a strongly bent five-stranded beta-sheet Strand beta-5 of each Sm protein is paired with strand beta-4 of the clockwise neighbour, while its beta-4 strand is paired with strand beta-5 of the counterclockwise neighbour. Phosphates, riboses and bases of the Sm site nucleotides are arranged in three concentric circles, with the phosphates forming the inner surface of a pore and the bases radiating outwards and lying in pockets provided by the Sm proteins.

EBI-11166292	Snf1 protein kinase complex variant GAL83	Energy sensor protein kinase complex, activated by glucose depletion. Regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes via derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Required for the diauxic shift, in which genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (normally repressed by glucose) are switched on; growth then resumes at a lower rate.  Role in filamentous invasive growth, on glucose depletion, in haploid cells. Regulates haploid invasive growth in response to glucose depletion by affecting adherence by antagonizing NRG1- and NRG2-mediated repression of the FLO11 flocculin and adhesin gene.  The activity of this complex is modulated by reversible phosphorylation of SNF1 Thr-210 which increases in response to glucose starvation and correlates with large increases in cellular ADP-to-ATP and AMP-to-ATP ratios. Binding of ADP, but not AMP, to the complex protects against dephosphorylation of Thr-210, suggesting that ADP, rather than AMP, may be the critical activating signal. When glucose levels are high, the complex is cytoplasmic. Upon glucose depletion, Gal83-containing SNF1 locates to the nucleus.

Surrounds the leading strand during DNA replication and recruits the DNA polymerase epsilon complex (CPX-2110) for leading-strand synthesis. CDC45 adds the GINS complex (CPX-1641) onto each MCM2-7 complex (CPX-2944) to form two active CMG helicases that surround each strand of parental DNA. CMG then translocates along single-strand DNA in the 3-prime to 5-prime direction for bidirectional replication. The complex unwinds duplex regions up to 500 bp.	The complex has a 20 A diameter opening at the bottom N-terminal domain (NTD) ring of the the MCM2-7 core forms a two-tiered ring structure, where the leading strand exits the MCM2-7 axial channel. The axial channel in the NTD ring is partially obstructed by two protruding loops that connect the first two beta-strands of the OB sub-domains (IPR033762) in MCM4 and MCM7 which are positioned directly below the ssDNA pore of the C-terminal domain (CTD)-the MCM2-7 complex ring where DNA enters.

EBI-11560071	VPS4 complex	An AAA-ATPase that is probably the main energy-providing system for the membrane deformation and abscission function of the ESCRT machinery consisting of ESCRT-0 (CPX-1622), -I (CPX-940), -II (CPX-1623), -III (CPX-1624) and -IV (this complex) . Required for the dissociation and recycling of ESCRT-III complex subunits from vesicle and plasma membranes as well as the midbody during the final stages of cytokinesis where it causes constriction of the ESCRT-III polymer and fission of the associated membrane neck. Multiple disassembly reactions are performed until ESCRT-III dissociation has been completed.   VPS4 ATPase activity is regulated by a) ESCRT-III interactions with VPS4 which enhance ATP hydrolysis by relieving autoinhibition of the AAA domain and b) binding of the VTA1 homodimers (Q06263) which both promotes VPS4 oligomerization and enhances ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ESCRT-III subunits DID2 (P69771) or VPS60 (Q03390) to the amino-terminal of VTA1 relieves autoinhibition within VTA1 to further enhance stimulation of VPS4 ATP hydrolysis. Binding of IST1 (P53843) to VPS4 negatively regulates VPS4 activity by blocking binding to the ESCRT machinery.	Soluble, catalytically inactive dimers or hexamers oligomerise upon interaction of its MIT domain with ESCRT-III MIM1 and/or MIM2 domains forming two stacked hexameric or heptameric rings with a central pore through which ESCRT-III substrates are translocated in an ATP-dependent manner.

May potentially be part of a larger Coenzyme A-synthesizing protein complex (CPX-396) but this is not yet clear.  The synthesis of CoA involves the phosphorylation of pantothenate (vitamin B5) to 4'-phosphopantothenate, to which a cysteine is then added to form  4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PCC). PPC is decarboxylated to 4'-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (this complex). 4'-phosphopantetheine is adenylylated to form dephospho-CoA which is then phosphorylated to form coenzyme A.	Two catalytically essential residues are required - His that is required for the first step of the enzyme?s two-step mechanism (an oxidative decarboxylation), and a Cys that is necessary for the second step (the reduction of the reaction intermediate). These are found on opposite sides of the active site, with VHS3 contributing the His residue whilst CAB3 contributes the Cys residue to give a complex with a single functional active site.

EBI-11702497	Glucosidase II complex	Glycoprotein-processing enzyme that successively cleaves the innermost two alpha1,3-linked glucose residues from N-linked oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum during glycoprotein biogenesis. The enzyme has dual activity, cleaving two alpha1,3-linked glucose residues in succession from Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 (G2M9) to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (G1M9) (cleavage-1), and then to Man9GlcNAc2 (M9) (cleavage-2). G1M9 plays a key role in glycoprotein quality control in the ER, because it is a primary ligand of the lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). Therefore, the cleavage-2 activity provides an exit for correctly folded glycoproteins from the CNX/CRT cycle, while the cleavage-1 activity provides an entry for immature glycoproteins into the cycle.

EBI-1205157	TIM23 mitochondrial inner membrane pre-sequence translocase complex, motor variant	Major pre-protein translocase in the inner membrane of mitochondria, mediates the translocation of N-terminal, positively charged pre-sequence-containing proteins. TIM50 interacts with incoming pre-sequence-carrying pre-proteins as they reach the trans site of the TOM40 complex (CPX-474). Pre-proteins are directed by the intermembrane space-exposed domains of TIM50, and TIM23 to the protein-conducting channel of the TIM23 complex. The pre-sequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) drives the completion of pre-protein translocation into the matrix. In most cases, the pre-sequence is proteolytically removed by the mitochondrial-processing peptidase (CPX-1630).	Translocation is energetically driven by the electrical membrane potential across the inner membrane where they interact with the ATP-bound state of SSC1 (HSP77/mtHSP70). Upon ATP hydrolysis, SSC1 tightly binds the incoming chain and is released from the TIM23 complex. Repeated SSC1-binding cycles drive complete translocation of the precursor protein. SSC1 is finally released upon exchange of the bound ADP for ATP, a reaction stimulated by MGE1 (GRPE). Membrane-bound PAM16-PAM18 (TIM14-TIM16)  regulates the ATPase activity of SSC1.

Loss-of-function mutation of any of 4 subunits in yeast causes disrupted kinetochore-microtubule binding and inactivation of the spindle checkpoint, leading to high rate of chromosome loss.	Ndc80 complex is rod-like with a globular head at each end. NDC80 and NUF2 form one head and part of rod and SPC24 and SPC25 form rest of rod and other head. SPC24 and SPC25 fold tightly together into a single globular entity. SPC24/SPC25 end of the complex appears to point to the centromere, and the NDC80/NUF2 end to the microtubule.

EBI-1212614	6-phosphofructokinase complex	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the presence of MgATP, the first irreversible step for glycolysis. The enzyme is stablilized in the presence of Fructose 6-P and exhibits cooperative binding of Fructose 6-P. Its activity is controlled by many allosteric activators and inhibitors (including ATP), showing its crucial role in regulation of glycolytic flux. The enzyme can exist in either the active R-state or inhibited T-state. The effectors either modulate the affinity of Pfk for Fructose 6-P or overcome inhibitory effects. Pfk is an octamer composed of 4 alpha and 4 beta subunits.	MW = 835 kDA (approximately). Each subunit is approximately 105 kDa. The native octameric structure has a sedimentation coefficient of 21 S. The molecule is elongated with length of 24 nm and width of 17 nm. There is mild asymmetry between the top and bottom tetramers, each composed of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.	4xPFK1:4xPFK2	YGR240C	Pfk1p

EBI-1225194	Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III	Key role in aerobic respiration, in which mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from electron carriers reduced in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.  Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase pumps protons into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient. This is achieved by oxidizing ubiquinol (ubihydroquinone) which reacts from the membrane phase, reducing cytochrome c in the intermembrane space, and using the free energy change to transport  H+ ions across the membrane from the matrix to the inter membrane space. Quinol oxidation occurs in a bifurcated reaction, in which one electron is transferred to a high potential chain and the other to a low potential chain. The high potential chain, consisting of the iron sulfur protein, cyt c1 and cyt c2, transfers the first electron from quinol to an acceptor (cytochrome oxidase). The low potential chain consists of two cyt b hemes, which serve as a pathway through which electrons are transferred across the coupling membrane.	The whole complex is believed to act as a dimer which binds to a single molecule of cytochrome C.	CYT1:COB:COR1:COR2:QCR6:QCR7:QCR8:QRC9:QRC10:RIP1	Q0105	Cobp

EBI-1248655	mRNA cap methyltransferase complex	Catalyzes the first step in mRNA cap formation. Consists of two subunits: an RNA 5'-triphosphatase (RTPase) and GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase (GTase). The GTase subunit (Ceg1) binds to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit (CTD-P) of RNA polymerase II, coupling capping with transcription. The subunits form a dimeric structure with 2 parallel tunnels, having at centre charged and hydrophilic side chains that bind a manganese ion and a sulfate ion. Ceg1 bound to the CTD-P is inactive unless allosterically activated by interaction with the RTPase subunit (Cet1). Cet1 removes the gamma-phosphate from the 5' end of the RNA substrate to leave a diphosphate end. Ceg1 subsequently transfers the GMP moiety of GTP to the 5' end of RNA via an enzyme-GMP covalent reaction intermediate to form the structure GpppN1-.	""	CEG1:2xCET1	YGL130W	Ceg1p

EBI-1248718	Casein kinase II complex, CKA1-CKA2 variant	CK2 is involved in regulation of cell cycle progression, presumably through phosphorylation of target proteins. CK2 may also have role(s) in inhibiting apoptosis. Phosphorylates serine or threonine residues proximal to acidic amino acids (consensus Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Acidic where acidic residue may be Glu, Asp, pSer or pTYr). Thought to be a dual-specificity kinase in yeast, also able to phosphorylate tyrosine residues, although with less favourable kinetic parameters. ATP or GTP can serve as a phosphate donor. Disruption of CKA1 or CKA2 is not lethal, but disruption of both is synthetic lethal. CKA1 and CKA2 functional overlap is not complete, as yeast with temperature sensitive alleles of CKA1 or CKA2 display distinct phenotypes and different combinations of CKA subunits affect substrate specificity and sub-cellular localization. Disruption of CKB1 or CKB2 causes sensitivity to NaCl and LiCl. Disruption of both CKB1 and CKB2 is not synthetic lethal, although the regulatory subunits are responsible for the structural integrity of the holoenzyme. Much of CK2B is phosphorylated on autophosphorylation site and also in a cell cycle-dependent manner.	Km for ATP=7.5uM, KM for GTP=52uM.

MW = 150,000 Da.CK2 isoenzymes composed of catalytic alpha and/or alpha-prime subunits with homodimers of regulatory beta2 or beta-prime2 subunits are apparently not formed.

EBI-1249909	Calcineurin complex variant 1	A Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, highly conserved through evolution and a critical component of Ca2+-regulated signaling in a wide range of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. Calcineurin is a heterodimer containing a catalytic (A) subunit complexed with an essential regulatory (B) subunit. Calcineurin function requires interaction of both subunits. The catalytic subunit contains an active site dinuclear metal center. The regulatory subunit is tightly associated, myristoylated and binds Ca2+ via four Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs. Two redundant genes, CNA1 and CNA2, encode the catalytic subunit and their expression is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In the yeast, Ca2+ signaling mediated by calcineurin, is required for survival during environmental stress. One role of the phosphatase under these conditions is to activate gene expression through its regulation of the CRZ1 (P53968)  transcription factor. Calcineurin controls many other physiological processes in yeast, including cell cycle progression, cation homeostasis, morphogenesis, establishment of cell polarity and regulation of cell wall biosynthesis. Cells deficient for calcineurin are unable to survive pheromone-induced G1 arrest. When mobilization of internal calcium stores occurs, the catalytic subunit is bound by Ca2+-calmodulin and the active site is freed by displacement of the autoinhibitory domain.	CNA1 and CNA2 are translated into proteins with predicted molecular masses of 63 and 68 kDa.	CNA1:CNB1	YKL190W	Cnb1p

EBI-12501304	Nuclear/nucleolar exosome complex, DIS3-RRP6 variant	3' to 5' exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process.   Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603).  The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3? end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly also involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin and transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.	The RNA exosome contains a catalytically inactive but evolutionarily conserved core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9). This barrel-shaped Exo-9 is formed by a hexameric ring of RNase PH domain-containing subunits RRP41-RRP45, RRP46-RRP43 and MTR3-RRP42, and a peripheral cap consisting of S1 domain-containing components CSL4, RRP4 and RRP40 located on the top of the ring structure. Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity but facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunits. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) and RRP6 bind to the base of Exo-9 and to its cap-side, respectively.

EBI-12501304	Nuclear/nucleolar exosome complex, DIS3-RRP6 variant	3' to 5' exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3' end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunits, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3' to 5' orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunits facilitates the degradation process.   Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (this complex), the other form is lacking the RRP6 subunit and is found in the cytosol (CPX-603).  The nuclear/nucleolar RNA exosome is involved in a) proper maturation of most RNA species such as intron-removal from pre-mRNAs and tRNA precursors and rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, lncRNA and enhancer RNA processing, especially the removal of their 3-prime ends, b) the elimination of RNA processing by-products and non-coding, cryptic transcripts, such as upstream antisense RNA species (uaRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), heterochromatin-forming repetitive elements (ribosomal DNA repeats and centromeres) and long non-coding RNAs, c) the elimination of mRNAs with processing defects and mRNAs that fail to undergo proper splicing or 3? end formation and d) gene expression either by mRNA processing or coordination of intron retention leading to regulation of decay of otherwise intact mRNAs. Nuclear exosome activity therefore limits or excludes export of target RNAs to the cytoplasm. Possibly also involved in the degradation of mRNAs with defects in their co-transcriptional packaging into ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs), retention of aberrant transcripts on the chromatin and transcription termination or DNA damage repair processes.	The RNA exosome contains a catalytically inactive but evolutionarily conserved core complex of 9 subunits (Exo-9).

This barrel-shaped Exo-9 is formed by a hexameric ring of RNase PH domain-containing subunits RRP41-RRP45, RRP46-RRP43 and MTR3-RRP42, and a peripheral cap consisting of S1 domain-containing components CSL4, RRP4 and RRP40 located on the top of the ring structure. Exo-9 has no exoribonuclease activity but facilitates the binding and presentation of RNA for ribonucleolysis and serves as a scaffold for the association with the catalytic subunit. Full ribonuclease activity is only achieved when DIS3 (RRP44) binds to the base of Exo-9.	CSL4:DIS3:MTR3:RRP4:RRP40:RRP42:RRP43:RRP45:RRP46:SKI6	YGR158C	Mtr3p
EBI-12501968	Cytoplasmic exosome complex, DIS3 variant	3-prime to 5-prime exo- and endoribonuclease complex that is involved in RNA maturation and degradation which include the removal of unstable and aberrant transcripts and may also regulate the levels of specific transcripts in response to environmental factors. Restricted to processing linear and circular single-stranded RNAs only. RNAs with complex secondary structures, particularly at the 3-prime end of the molecule, may have to be unwound or pre-processed by co-factors prior to entering the complex. Although some RNAs may be targeted directly to the catalytic subunit, the majority of substrates enter the barrel-like structure of the exosome through a pore at the centre of the cap and are threaded through the central channel in a 3-prime to 5-prime orientation. The ribonuclease activity of the catalytic subunit facilitates the degradation process.   Two different exosomes exist in yeast, one found in the nucleus and nucleolus (CPX-599), the other form is lacking the RRP6 (Q12149) subunit and is found in the cytosol (this complex).  The cytoplasmic RNA exosome is involved in general mRNA turnover (esp of Polymerase III transcripts) and specifically degrades inherently unstable mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) within their 3-prime untranslated regions and cytoplasmic rRNAs that have undergone polyadenylation.

EBI-1250459	Signal recognition particle	A conserved ribonucleoprotein particle, which includes in its structure a small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA). In co-translational targeting of membrane and secretory proteins, SRP recognizes signal sequences as soon as they emerge from the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel and binds to the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC), leading to retardation of peptide elongation. The SRP-RNC complex is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction with the SRP receptor (SR).  After docking to the membrane, the RNC is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, the translocon, and protein synthesis continues. The SRP-SR complex dissociates from the ribosome and, as a result of GTP hydrolysis, SRP and SR dissociate from each other. The genes encoding scR1 and SRP54 are not essential for growth, although SRP-deficient cells grow poorly, suggesting that an alternative, SRP-independent targeting pathway(s) to the ER membrane exists.	SRP is a 16 S particle.
GTP binding to both SRP and SR is required for SRP-SR complex formation.  Signal sequence binding and GTP-dependent interaction with SR are mediated by the SRP54 subunit, a multidomain protein with an N-terminal four-helix bundle (N domain), a central GTPase domain (G domain) and a C-terminal methionine-rich domain (M domain). The N-terminal domain (SRP54N) is tightly associated with the G domain (SRP54NG) and may be involved in regulating GTP affinity.

In co-translational targeting of membrane and secretory proteins, SRP recognizes signal sequences as soon as they emerge from the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel and binds to the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC), leading to retardation of peptide elongation. The SRP-RNC complex is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by interaction with the SRP receptor (SR).  After docking to the membrane, the RNC is transferred to the protein-conducting channel, the translocon, and protein synthesis continues. The SRP-SR complex dissociates from the ribosome and, as a result of GTP hydrolysis, SRP and SR dissociate from each other. The genes encoding scR1 and SRP54 are not essential for growth, although SRP-deficient cells grow poorly, suggesting that an alternative, SRP-independent targeting pathway(s) to the ER membrane exists.	SRP is a 16 S particle.
GTP binding to both SRP and SR is required for SRP-SR complex formation.  Signal sequence binding and GTP-dependent interaction with SR are mediated by the SRP54 subunit, a multidomain protein with an N-terminal four-helix bundle (N domain), a central GTPase domain (G domain) and a C-terminal methionine-rich domain (M domain). The N-terminal domain (SRP54N) is tightly associated with the G domain (SRP54NG) and may be involved in regulating GTP affinity.  At least SRP14, SRP21, SRP68 and SRP72 are proposed to get assembled together with scR1 RNA as a pre-SRP complex in the nucleolus which is exported to the cytoplasm.

EBI-1252323	Anaphase-Promoting core complex	APC, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, is a conserved  cullin-RING E3 ubiqutin ligase which facilitates multiubiqutination of cell cycle proteins, including cyclins, so marking them for proteasomal destruction. Generally believed that APC acts as a scaffold that brings E2 enzymes and substrates into close proximity. APC activity is required for metaphase-anaphase transition, mitotic exit, G1 phase and DNA replication. Targets securin for destruction, which is necessary for chromosome segregation. APC seems to have similar function in meiosis. Co-activators, CDC20 and CDH1, associate with APC core complex at specific stages of cell cycle, and are thought to be involved in substrate specificity. APC-Cdc20 (CPX-760) is active in presence of high cyclin-cdk activity in M phase but after metaphase when cyclin-cdk activity decreases, Cdh1 is dephosphorylated, CDC20 is degraded and APC-CDH1 (CPX-761) activated. Ama1 (CPX-762) is meiotic co-activator required for sporulation and contributes to securin degradation and cyclin Clb5 in anaphase of meiosis. All APC co-activators, characterized by the presence of sequence elements, C-box and the IR-tail, that mediate their binding to APC, contain a C-terminal WD40 domain, predicted to fold into a propeller-like structure, believed to recognize APC substrates by interacting with specific recognition elements in substrates, D-boxes and KEN-boxes. Genetic inactivation of APC is lethal.	MW = 1.7 MDa. APC is an asymmetric triangular complex (200 by 230 A in size), composed of an outer wall that encloses an internal cavity. The largest APC subunit, APC1, bridges two distinct subcomplexes, the ?catalytic core? subcomplex including APC2 and APC11, the Cullin and RING-finger subunits that characterize the APC as a member of the multisubunit cullin-RING family of ubiquitin ligases, and the three TPR subunits CDC27, CDC16, and CDC23, and requires APC4 and APC5 to interact with Apc1. May also exist as a dimer in vivo. Purified APC forms dimers in vitro, which have enhanced processivity.	APC1:APC2:APC4:APC5:APC9:APC11:CDC16:CDC23:CDC26:CDC27:DOC1:MND2:SWM1	YBL084C	Cdc27p

CK2 may also have role(s) in inhibiting apoptosis.Phosphorylates serine or threonine residues proximal to acidic amino acids (consensus Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Acidic where acidic residue may be Glu, Asp, pSer or pTYr). Thought to be a dual-specificity kinase in yeast, also able to phosphorylate tyrosine residues, although with less favourable kinetic parameters. ATP or GTP can serve as a phosphate donor. Disruption of CKA1 or CKA2 is not lethal, but disruption of both is synthetic lethal. CKA1 and CKA2 functional overlap is not complete, as yeast with temperature sensitive alleles of CKA1 or CKA2 display distinct phenotypes and different combinations of CKA subunits affect substrate specificity and sub-cellular localization. Disruption of CKB1 or CKB2 causes sensitivity to NaCl and LiCl. Disruption of both CKB1 and CKB2 is not synthetic lethal, although the regulatory subunits are responsible for the structural integrity of the holoenzyme. Much of CK2B is phosphorylated on autophosphorylation site and also in a cell cycle-dependent manner.	Km for ATP=4.5uM, KM for GTP=50uM.

EBI-1255825	Nuclear pore complex	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large assembly embedded in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. The yeast nucleus contains approximately 200 NPCs per cell and as the sole site of macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the complex provides an important control point for the regulation of gene expression. Inert polymers and small proteins less than 9 nm in diameter or less than 30-40 kDa in mass can freely diffuse through the NPC, larger particles traverse the NPC by a facilitated mechanism with the structure able to expand radially to accommodate the passage of larger particles. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope with dimensions of 96 nm diameter by 35 nm high in yeast.

The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. 

Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. 

The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. 

There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. 

The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. 

GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket.

The yeast nucleus contains approximately 200 NPCs per cell and as the sole site of macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the complex provides an important control point for the regulation of gene expression. Inert polymers and small proteins less than 9 nm in diameter or less than 30-40 kDa in mass can freely diffuse through the NPC, larger particles traverse the NPC by a facilitated mechanism with the structure able to expand radially to accommodate the passage of larger particles. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope with dimensions of 96 nm diameter by 35 nm high in yeast.

The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. 

Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. 

The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. 

There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. 

The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. 

GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup100 and NUP145N may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NSP1 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. 

NDC1, NUP53, ASM4 (NUP59), POM34 and POM152 are transmembrane NUPs forming the membrane ring subcomplex.

These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. 

There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. 

The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. 

GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket.

EBI-1255825	Nuclear pore complex	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large assembly embedded in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. The yeast nucleus contains approximately 200 NPCs per cell and as the sole site of macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the complex provides an important control point for the regulation of gene expression. Inert polymers and small proteins less than 9 nm in diameter or less than 30-40 kDa in mass can freely diffuse through the NPC, larger particles traverse the NPC by a facilitated mechanism with the structure able to expand radially to accommodate the passage of larger particles. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope with dimensions of 96 nm diameter by 35 nm high in yeast.

The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes.

EBI-1255825	Nuclear pore complex	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large assembly embedded in the nuclear envelope of eukaryotic cells. The yeast nucleus contains approximately 200 NPCs per cell and as the sole site of macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm, the complex provides an important control point for the regulation of gene expression. Inert polymers and small proteins less than 9 nm in diameter or less than 30-40 kDa in mass can freely diffuse through the NPC, larger particles traverse the NPC by a facilitated mechanism with the structure able to expand radially to accommodate the passage of larger particles. The nuclear basket subunits play an active role in transcription, transcriptional memory and chromatin organization by recruiting members of the transcription machinery to the nuclear side of the NCP.	The nuclear pore complex has a hollow cylindrical shape with eight-fold rotational symmetry along the axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope with dimensions of 96 nm diameter by 35 nm high in yeast.

The nucleoporin proteins (NUPs) assemble into several sub-complexes that form higher-order structures called spokes. Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. 

Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. 

The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. 

There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. 

The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. 

GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket.

Eight spokes assemble into larger modules: coaxial outer and inner rings form a symmetric core scaffold, which is connected to a membrane ring, a nuclear basket and cytoplasmic RNA export complexes. 

Each of the constituent proteins is present in 8-56 copies, with a total of 552 proteins in yeast. 

The scaffold surrounds a central channel that is formed in part by multiple intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) repeat motifs that extend from nucleoporins termed FG NUPs. These FG motifs mediate selective nucleocytoplasmic transport through specific interactions with nuclear transport factors, which carry their cognate macromolecular cargoes. 

There are a total of 32 repeating Y subcomplexes consisting of 7 subunits, NUP133, NUP84, NUP85, NUP120, NUP145C, SEC13 and SEH1. They are arranged in four rings of 8 subcomplexes, 2 rings each making up the main components of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rings (NR, CR). Within each CR and NR, there are 2 rings of 8, the inner and outer rings. 

The inner ring complex (IRC) consists at least of NUP157, NUP170, NUP188 and NUP192. Anchored to the IRC inside the pore is a FG-NUP-enriched subcomplex composed of NSP1, NIC96, NUP49 and NUP57. The inner ring harbours the central transport channel and diffusion barrier of the NPC, preventing macromolecules larger than 30-40 kDa from freely diffusing across the nuclear envelope. 

GLE1, GLE2, NUP42, NUP116 and subcomplex NSP1-NUP82-NUP159-DYN2 localize to the cytoplasmic side and contribute to the cytoplasmic filaments, whereas NUP1, NUP2, NUP60, MLP1 and MLP2 localize to the nuclear side and form the nuclear basket. Nup100 and NUP145N may occur on the cytoplasmic and nuclear side while NSP1 may occur on the cytoplasmic side and the inner channel. 

NDC1, NUP53, ASM4 (NUP59), POM34 and POM152 are transmembrane NUPs forming the membrane ring subcomplex.

The N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) modification is present at position 37 of tRNAs that recognize ANN-codons, with N being any nucleotide, enhancing the codon-anti-codon interaction and is required for recognition of the AUG start codon. The modification is thus important for maintaining translational fidelity and also appears to play a role in transcription and telomere homeostasis. The unstable TCA intermediate is synthesised from ATP, threonine and bicarbonate by the SUA5 (P32579) enzyme.	The complex forms a linear heteropentameric structure. The active site of KAE1, centered on the conserved metal cluster and containing an ATP binding site, is at the bottom of a crater whose walls are made of KAE1, BUD32, PCC1 and GON7. Residues from KAE1, BUD32 and PCC1 contribute to a positively-charged surface patch around the ATP binding site of KAE1, which may be involved in tRNA binding. Binding to KAE1 appears to maintain BUD32 in an inactive conformation inhibiting its kinase activity.	BUD32:CGI121:GON7:KAE1:PCC1	YGR262C	Bud32p

Subunits BRE2 and SDC1 are essential for trimethylation and important for mono- and dimethylation by the COMPASS complex. SPP1 is important for trimethylation, while SHG1 plays a minor role in trimethylation.	MW = 1MDa	2XBRE2:SDC1:2xSET1:SHG1:2xSPP1:SWD1:SWD2:SWD3	YPL138C	Spp1p
EBI-1371206	SKI complex	Central component of the 3'-5' cytoplasmic mRNA degradation pathway which interacts with Ski7 (Q08491) to mediate degradation by the exosome. The Ski complex appears to thread RNAs directly to the exosome, coupling the helicase and the exoribonuclease through a continuous RNA channel.	 Ski3 forms an array of 33 TPR motifs organized in N-terminal and C-terminal arms. The C-terminal arm of Ski3 and the two Ski8 subunits position the helicase core of Ski2 centrally within the complex, enhancing RNA binding. The Ski3 N-terminal arm and the Ski2 insertion domain allosterically modulate the ATPase and helicase activities of the complex.

EBI-1379972	DASH complex	Heterodecameric component of the kinetochore necessary for accurate chromosome segregation, supporting the dynamic attachment of mitotic chromosomes to the ends of shortening spindle microtubules. DASH forms closed rings around microtubules with a large gap between the DASH ring and the microtubule cylinder. A DASH-microtubule interface is believed to form, in which extensions from DASH rings reach across a gap between the ring and the microtubule and dock on the microtubule wall. DASH rings spontaneously oligomerize in the presence of microtubules of the mitotic spindle. DASH rings are processivity factors that allow kinetochores to translate along a single microtubule without dissociating. Each DASH ring may contain from 16-30 heterodecamers. The NDC80 complex (CPX-548) can simultaneously bind and bridge across two DASH complex rings through a tripartite interaction, each component of which is regulated by IPL1 kinase (P38991). This ensures a consistent spacing between rings. The complex may also may serve as a link between the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle.	MW of the heterodecamer = 211 +/- 16 kDa, MW of the DASH ring = 5 MDa. The heterodecamer is relatively globular in solution with a 130-150 A diameter. The Stokes radius of 76 A is larger than expected for a 200-kDa protein. Along with the calculated frictional coefficient of 1.90, this  suggests either an elongated shape or the presence of unstructured extensions. EM images suggest a 16-fold symmetry.

EBI-13916660	GAL3-GAL80 transcription regulation complex	Acts to relieve the repression of the GAL4  positive regulator of gene expression. The GAL network is a small set of genes that regulates galactose import and metabolism. The transcriptional activator GAL4 activates a set of enzymatic and regulatory genes by binding to their promoter regions. When galactose is the sole carbon source, the galactose-metabolizing enzymes are expressed at 1000 times their level in glucose.   In the absence of galactose, GAL4 activity is repressed by forming a complex with the transcriptional repressor GAL80 (CPX-1044). In the presence of galactose and ATP, the GAL3-GAL80 complex forms, removing GAL80 from the GAL4-activation domain, which is then able to recruit the transcriptional machinery. It is also possible a tripartite complex forms (GAL4-GAL80-GAL3), which counterbalances the effect of GAL80 on GAL4 and allows GAL4 to interact with  promoters. GAL3 primarily binds with ATP and galactose in the cytoplasm,  then moves into the nucleus to interact with GAL80. A paralogous complex, GAL1-GAL80 (CPX-1043) can also form but appears to have lower activity as a transcriptional inducer of GAL genes. It is possible that GAL3-GAL80 may be involved solely in the short-term response to galactose and GAL1-GAL80 is required for continued expression of the GAL genes.	The interaction between the two GAL80 occurs largely through the interaction between two large beta-sheets, forming a very extensive dimerization surface. The interaction between the two GAL3 molecules is less extensive and occurs largely through water molecules.The GAL3-GAL80 interaction occurs through a complex network of hydrogen bonds. GAL3 binds galactose and Mg2+-ATP, which induce the closed conformation of the protein and enables GAL80 binding.  A 2543 A2 surface area gets buried when a dimer of GAL80 binds the two monomers of GAL3, and an additional 647 A2 is buried due to GAL80-induced GAL3 dimer formation. 	2xGAL3:2xGAL80	YDR009W	Gal3p

TRM112 stabilizes BUD23 through the formation of a beta-zipper, which masks an important solvent-unfavorable hydrophobic surface on BUD23, and undergoes an induced fit to accommodate BUD23  binding. Large steric clashes between BUD23-TRM112 and ribosomal components suggest this complex cannot bind mature ribosomes and has to dissociate from the 40S subunit before completion of its biosynthesis.

EBI-13939513	Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex	Endonuclease complex required for mRNA 3' end processing to form a defined 3' end of the transcribed RNA. The complex cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination. The 3' end of mature mRNAs is generated by a site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of an internal phosphodiester bond of the primary transcript by YSH1. The upstream cleavage product generated is then polyadenylated by PAP1 to form a 50-90 adenosine tail at its 3-prime hydroxyl end, which is required for nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The downstream cleavage product is rapidly degraded. Cleavage and polyadenylation cycles are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation of CPF is inhibitory to polyadenylation therefore dephosphorylation of CPF by GLC7 is required to switch the processing complex to one competent for poly(A) addition.	The nuclease, polymerase, and phosphatase activities of the CPF complex are organized into three modules. The poly(A) polymerase module contains five subunits: CFT1, PFS2, PAP1, FLP1, and YTH1 CFT1 forms the core of the complex and is composed of three seven-bladed beta-propellers followed by a C-terminal helical domain. The nuclease module is composed of three subunits (YSH1, CFT2, and MPE1), whereas the phosphatase module contains seven subunits (PTA1, REF2, PTI1, SWD2, GLC7, SSU72, and SYC1).

The complex has also been implicated in the unwinding of strand invasion after extension of the invading 3-prime end by DNA synthesis to promote DSB repair by synthesis-dependent strand annealing, as well as reversal of strand invasion prior to 3-prime end extension. Through these functions, the complex promotes non-crossover outcomes of HR and regulates HR levels.	""	RMI1:SGS1:TOP3	YLR234W	Top3p

EBI-1396149	RNA polymerase I upstream activating factor complex	Binds tightly to the upstream element of the yeast Pol I promoter and is essential for a high level of transcription of the 35S rRNA gene. UAF has dual functions: both as a positive transcription factor for Pol I, and as a silencer for Pol II transcription of rRNA genes. Deletion of any one of the subunit protein genes encoding essential nonhistone proteins causes derepression of Pol II transcription of the 35S rRNA genes. The association of H3 and H4 with the other UAF components is important for the stability of UAF in vivo and, hence, for rRNA transcription by Pol I. Initiation of transcription requires the assembly of UAF, the core factor (CPX-1836), the TATA binding protein SPT15 (P13393), and RNAP-I (CPX-1664) with RRN3 (P36070) on the upstream element and core promoter.

MTW1 is only present in low levels so may only associate with the complex.	""	AME1:CHL4:CTF19:CTF3:IML3:MCM16:MCM21:MCM22:MTW1:NKP1:NKP2:OKP1	YPR046W	Mcm16p

EBI-15483941	Cytoplasmic dynein complex	A microtubule minus end-directed motor complex involved in positioning the mitotic spindle during cell division. Yeast undergoes a closed mitosis, and therefore the nucleus and its mitotic spindle must be positioned across the junction between the mother and bud, termed the bud neck, to provide a set of chromosomes to the daughter cell.  Dynein anchors to the bud end and becomes activated, allowing force generation between the microtubule and the cortex. The microtubule is pulled to slide along the cortex, causing the spindle to move into the mother-bud neck .Chemical transitions (ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP) are coupled to structural changes in the motor, whilst conversely, mechanical events (such as microtubule binding) can influence the rate of chemical transitions.	The dynein complex consists of a dimer heavy chains and a number of intermediate and light chains. The dynein heavy chain contains an N-terminal dimerization/cargo-binding domain and a C-terminal motor domain consisting of a hexameric array of AAA+ ATPase domains. The extended tail of the heavy chain binds to the intermediate (PAC11), light intermediate (DYN3) and light chain (DYN2) subunits.

EBI-16019513	RAD26-DEF1 stalled RNAPII response complex	Appears to form in response to DNA damage-stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAPII, CPX-2662), when the stall is persistent such as at DNA lesions. RAD26 appears to protect RNAPII from degradation to allow time for repair. When the lesion cannot be rapidly removed by RAD26-promoted DNA repair, DEF1 enables ubiquitination and proteolysis of RNAPII. The complex may therefore act to coordinate a stalling rescue mechanism driven by the two proteins.	""	DEF1:RAD26	YJR035W	Rad26p

EBI-16210364	Vacuolar proton translocating ATPase complex, Golgi variant	Translocates protons across a lipid bilayer via an ATP-driven rotary mechanism, thus acidifing the lumen of its resident organelle. As newly synthesized proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus they undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, and are targeted to their appropriate destination in a pH-dependent manner. Membrane-bound ion transporters/proton exchangers use the pH gradient to sequester metal ions to the vacuole and other cellular organelles. The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The variant of the complex containing the STV1 subunit results in the retention of the V-ATPase complex on Golgi and endosomal membranes. The N-terminal domain of STV1 contains the W83KY sequence, which is necessary and sufficient for targeting the complex to the Golgi apparatus. When yeast cells are deprived of glucose, the V1 and VO regions separate and are no longer able to hydrolyze ATP and transport protons.	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c', c'', d, e, f and VOA1 (VPH1 or STV1, VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, VMA6, VMA9, YPR170W-B, VOA1). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (VMA1, VMA2, VMA5, VMA8, VMA4, VMA7, VMA10, and VMA13) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring (c8c'c'' VOA1). The c, c', and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring.

EBI-16210364	Vacuolar proton translocating ATPase complex, Golgi variant	Translocates protons across a lipid bilayer via an ATP-driven rotary mechanism, thus acidifing the lumen of its resident organelle. As newly synthesized proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus they undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation, and are targeted to their appropriate destination in a pH-dependent manner. Membrane-bound ion transporters/proton exchangers use the pH gradient to sequester metal ions to the vacuole and other cellular organelles. The combined action of the V-ATPase and membrane transporters plays a key role in maintaining cellular homoeostasis. The variant of the complex containing the STV1 subunit results in the retention of the V-ATPase complex on Golgi and endosomal membranes. The N-terminal domain of STV1 contains the W83KY sequence, which is necessary and sufficient for targeting the complex to the Golgi apparatus. When yeast cells are deprived of glucose, the V1 and VO regions separate and are no longer able to hydrolyze ATP and transport protons.	The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c', c'', d, e, f and VOA1 (VPH1 or STV1, VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, VMA6, VMA9, YPR170W-B, VOA1). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (VMA1, VMA2, VMA5, VMA8, VMA4, VMA7, VMA10, and VMA13) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring (c8c'c'' VOA1).

The V-ATPase complex can be functionally separated into two subcomplexes: the V1 domain is a 600-650 kDa peripheral complex involved directly in ATP hydrolysis and the integral membrane V0 domain responsible for the translocation of protons across a membrane bilayer. The membrane-embedded V0 domain is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and is composed of components a, c, c', c'', d, e, f and VOA1 (VPH1 or STV1, VMA3, VMA11, VMA16, VMA6, VMA9, YPR170W-B, VOA1). The soluble V1 domain contains subunits A-H (VMA1, VMA2, VMA5, VMA8, VMA4, VMA7, VMA10, and VMA13) and consists of three catalytic AB heterodimers that form a heterohexamer, three peripheral stalks each consisting of EG heterodimers, one central rotor including subunits D and F, and the regulatory subunits C and H. Sequential ATP hydrolysis by the AB subunits produces conformational changes in the A3B3 hexamer that induce rotation of the central stalk (DFd) and the c-ring (c8c'c'' VOA1). The c, c', and c'' subunits that form the c-ring have conserved glutamate residues on their outer alpha-helices that are required for proton translocation. For every three ATP hydrolysis events, there is one complete rotation of the central stalk and c-ring. 	3xVMA1:3xVMA2:8xVMA3:3xVMA4:VMA5:VMA6:VMA7:VMA8:VMA9:3xVMA10:VMA11:VMA13:VMA16:VOA1:VPH1:YPR170W-B	YGR106C	Voa1p

EBI-16362814	Gamma tubulin small complex	Seeds microtubule nucleation at microtubule-organizing centres, controlling the location and timing of nucleation. Component of the spindle pole body, which is responsible for the nucleation and organisation of microtubules within the cell, thus playing a role in chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis and controlling cytoplasmic interphase microtubules. The complex is bound directly to the spindle pole body  by SPC110 (P32380) on the nuclear face and SPC72 (P39723) on the cytoplasmic face.	Y-shaped, with an elongated body connected to two arms. The body consists of the  N-terminal regions of SPC97 and SPC98. The C-terminal regions of SPC97 and SPC98 form the base of each arm of the Y, and TUB4 forms part of a lobe at the end of each arm. Binding of GTP to gamma-tubulin regulates the strength of its interaction with tubulin. The complex then assembles into a single helical turn consisting of 7 gamma-tubulin small complex units, leaving 13 exposed gamma-tubulins, thus allowing 13-protofilament microtubule filaments to template from the complex. 

The spindle pole body (SPB) consists of a series of stacked layers embedded in the nuclear envelope. The inner plaque is the area where the microtubules dock to the SPB and harbors the gamma-tubulin small complex and the N-terminus of SPC110. The central plaque (CPX-1419) and the Intermediate layer 2 (IL2, CPX-1420) layer are the two core layers. This core is composed of 5 proteins. SPC29 and CMD1 reside in the central plaque. SPC42 is thought to begin within the central plaque, but terminate in the IL2 layer. The C-terminus of SPC110 is in the central plaque where it binds CMD1. The C-terminus of CNM67 lies in the IL2 layer where it binds SPC42 and links the SPB core to the outer plaque. The outer plaque is the cytoplasmic boundary of the SPB where the astral microtubules nucleate from a second region of gamma-tubulin.	SPC97:SPC98:2XTUB4	YHR172W	Spc97p

EBI-16420380	Nonsense-mediated decay complex	Recognizes and elicits the rapid degradation of mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation and also regulates the expression of specific genes by degrading natural mRNAs. Nonsence-mediated decay (NMD) is triggered by the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) context surrounding the translation termination event. NMD targets can be recognized as targets due to the lack of factors bound downstream from the termination codon. A ribosome terminating translation at a termination codon substantially upstream from the poly(A) tail terminates translation inefficiently. NMD may occur because the PAB1 (P04147) or other factor bound to the poly(A) tail is not in close enough proximity to the terminating ribosome to enable interaction of the PAB1 with SUP35 (P05453), which is bound to the terminating ribosome and thus establishes the correct mRNP context for a normal translation termination event. In the absence of correct translation termination, the nonsense-mediated decay complex interacts with the translation release factor ERF1-ERF3 complex (CPX-435), resulting in an aberrant translation termination event and NMD activation. NMD activation leads to the decapping of the mRNA by the decapping complex, DCP1-DCP2 (CPX-1628), followed by 5-prime to 3-prime degradation of the mRNA by the exoribonuclease XRN1 (P22147).

EBI-16426213	bI3 intron splicing factor complex	Self-splicing ribozymal RNA Group I intron splicing factor. A guanosine cofactor docks onto an active G-binding site and hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond at the splice site located in P1, resulting in a free hydroxyl group at the upstream exon and the guanosine cofactor being attached to the 5-prime end of the intron. The terminal guanosine of the intron then occupies the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction leading to the ligation of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and release of the catalytic intron.	The catalytic core of the complex is formed at the interface of three RNA domains held in a precise and catalytically active three-dimensional architecture by inter-domain tertiary interactions  stabilized by protein cofactors. The group I intron RNA core consists of two extended and roughly coaxially stacked helices that form a catalytic cleft, which binds, in turn, the 5-prime and 3-prime splice site helices and the guanosine 5-prime-monophosphate cofactor. The BI3 maturase and MRS1 bind the intron independently and assemble to form an active ribonucleoprotein catalyst of approximately 420 kDa.	BI3:4xMRS1	Q0115	Bi3p

EBI-16519146	Vesicular SNARE complex SSO1-SEC9-SNC1	An exocytic SNARE complex required for the fusion of post-Golgi secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane and is active primarily in vegetative cells. Mediates membrane fusion through the spontaneous assembly of four complementary SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) motifs. SNAREs bind to each other in-trans, that is, with SNAREs anchored in each apposed tethered membrane. The assembly process leads to a tight connection between the linked membranes and initiates membrane fusion.	When interacting sets of SNAREs are combined, the SNARE motifs spontaneously associate to form elongated coiled coils of four intertwined, parallel alpha-helices (a SNAREpin), with each helix being provided by a different SNARE motif. The centre of the bundle contains 16 stacked layers of interacting side chains. These layers are largely hydrophobic, except for a central 0 layer that contains three highly conserved glutamine (Q) residues and one highly conserved arginine (R) residue. SNARE motifs are classified into Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs and the hetero-oligomeric SNARE complexes that drive membrane fusion require that each parallel four-helix bundle is invariant and contains one each of the Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. SEC9 provides both Qb and Qc SNAREpin from its N- and C-terminal SNARE domain respectively. SSO1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that can prevent premature binary SSO1-SEC9 complex assembly.

The complex is also required for full initiation capacity of ORC-mediated replication initiation at consensus sequence within origins of replication in the genome.	""	HST1:RFM1:SUM1	YOR279C	Rfm1p
EBI-16586568	Synapsis initiation complex	Forms at axial association sites, where the chromosomes are in close contact, and is required for polymerization of ZIP1 (P31111) along the lengths of chromosomes during synapsis, the pairing of two homologous chromosomes that occurs during meiosis.  ZIP1 polymerization into oligomeric arrays of transverse filaments leads to the formation of the synaptonemal complex, a proteinaceous connection between homologous chromosomes which forms during meiotic prophase. The accumulation of the  ZIP1 appears to require the SUMO E3 ligase activity  of CST9. The complex may also promote MSH4-MSH5 complex (CPX-1704)-mediated crossovers, the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis.	""	CST9:SPO16:SPO22:ZIP2	YGL249W	Zip2p

EBI-16630498	Spliceosomal commitment complex	Formation of this complex is the first defined step in the yeast splicing pathway and is responsible for intron recognition, which targets pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. Binding of the 5-prime end of U1 snRNP (CPX-23) to the 5-prime splice site through base-pairing forms first a basal complex only dependent on a 5-prime splice site (CC1) and then a more stable second complex dependent on a branchpoint as well as a 5-prime splice site region (CC2). Interactions between the BBP-MUD2 branchpoint-binding complex (CPX-1417) and the U1 snRNP protein PRP40 (P33203) defines a bridge between the two ends of the intron. PRP5 may interact with U1 snRNP and other proteins to bridge the 5' splice site and the UACUAACA box of the pre-mRNA's branchpoint region.

The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.	MYO4 contains an N?terminal ?head? or motor domain, containing the actin?binding and ATP catalytic sites, followed by an extended ?neck? domain formed by six in?tandem IQ motifs. Following the neck is the ?tail? domain, which contains a region predicted to form a coiled?coil and a C?terminal globular domain. The IQ motifs constitute the binding sites for Ca2+?free (or apo) Calmodulin (CaM) and CaM?like light chains. IQ motifs are approximately 25 amino acids long with the consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR. Apo?CaM is the primary light chain of myosin V, occupying approximately four out of the six IQ sites, however binding of the light chain MLC1  is essential.	CMD1:MLC1:MYO4	YAL029C	Myo4p
EBI-16700567	Myosin class V complex, MYO4 variant	Building block of the class V myosin processive molecular motor involved in a range of organelle-transporting functions, including the transport of vacuoles and mRNA. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.	MYO4 contains an N?terminal ?head? or motor domain, containing the actin?binding and ATP catalytic sites, followed by an extended ?neck? domain formed by six in?tandem IQ motifs. Following the neck is the ?tail? domain, which contains a region predicted to form a coiled?coil and a C?terminal globular domain.

EBI-16710353	40S cytosolic small ribosomal subunit	Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Acts as the decoding centre of the ribosome which brings mRNA and aminoacylated transfer (t)RNAs together, with the 16S ribosomal (r)RNA being  required for the selection of the cognate tRNA.	Due to genome duplication, believed to have been caused by two different ancestral species mating followed by substantial losses of duplicated genes through degenerative processes, the 33 different proteins of the small ribosomal subunit are encoded by 57 genes. It has been suggested that, for each duplicated gene, one ribosomal protein gene (RPG) may provide most of the expressed transcript needed for growth under normal condition, while the other provides the extra RP protein amounts and/or function needed for optimum growth in response to a changing environment. The core of the 40S subunit is formed by the 18S ribosomal RNA, whilst the ribosomal proteins create binding sites for the mRNA and the tRNA A-site, P-site and E-site. Whilst there is normally considered  a single copy of each polymer in the mature ribosome, there is evidence that the composition can vary in response to physiological conditions, potentially  altering the translational efficiency of distinct mRNAs.

EBI-16715909	60S cytosolic large ribosomal subunit	Component of the ribosome, the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Responsible for the catalytic activity of the ribosome, the peptidyltransferase activity required to catalyze peptide bond formation. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.	Due to genome duplication, believed to have been caused by two different ancestral species mating followed by substantial losses of duplicated genes through degenerative processes, the 46 different proteins of the large ribosomal subunit are encoded by 81 genes. It has been suggested that, for each duplicated gene, one ribosomal protein gene (RPG) may provide most of the expressed transcript needed for growth under normal condition, while the other provides the extra RP protein amounts and/or function needed for optimum growth in response to a changing environment.

EBI-16717006	Small ribosomal subunit processome	Mediates the early stages of maturation of the small ribosomal subunit by coupling RNA folding to subsequent RNA cleavage and processing steps. A 47S precursor transcript contains coding segments for the small ribosomal subunit (18S) and large ribosomal subunit (28S and 5.8S) and regulatory regions including the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS). The SSU processome binds to the 5' ETS and cleaves the precursor transcript at site A1, which separates the 5? ETS and 18S segments. and then drives the transition toward a pre-40S particle.	The SSU processome proteins contain multiple beta-propellers (WD40 domains) and helical-repeat structures. Helical-repeat elements are frequently used to encapsulate RNA and protein elements, and act near the 5' and central domains to encapsulate and stabilize the conformation of RNA helices. UTP-A (CPX-1409) forms the base of the SSU processome, where it acts as a central scaffold that recognizes the first three helices of the 5' ETS. U3 snoRNA occupies a central position within the SSU processome and reaches from the outside into the core of the particle. By base-pairing with its 5' and 3' hinges to nucleotides within the 5' ETS, it rigidifies the structural scaffold provided by the 5' ETS. The 5' end of U3 snoRNA reaches further into the center of the SSU processome and base-pairs with two regions of the pre-18S rRNA. The GTPase BMS1 and the MPP10 complex (CPX-1893) are positioned in the core of the SSU processome.

EBI-16717006	Small ribosomal subunit processome	Mediates the early stages of maturation of the small ribosomal subunit by coupling RNA folding to subsequent RNA cleavage and processing steps. A 47S precursor transcript contains coding segments for the small ribosomal subunit (18S) and large ribosomal subunit (28S and 5.8S) and regulatory regions including the 5' external transcribed spacer (5' ETS). The SSU processome binds to the 5' ETS and cleaves the precursor transcript at site A1, which separates the 5? ETS and 18S segments. and then drives the transition toward a pre-40S particle.	The SSU processome proteins contain multiple beta-propellers (WD40 domains) and helical-repeat structures. Helical-repeat elements are frequently used to encapsulate RNA and protein elements, and act near the 5' and central domains to encapsulate and stabilize the conformation of RNA helices. UTP-A (CPX-1409) forms the base of the SSU processome, where it acts as a central scaffold that recognizes the first three helices of the 5' ETS. U3 snoRNA occupies a central position within the SSU processome and reaches from the outside into the core of the particle. By base-pairing with its 5' and 3' hinges to nucleotides within the 5' ETS, it rigidifies the structural scaffold provided by the 5' ETS.

Component of the Pol II preinitiation complex.  The TFIIH subunit XPB is an ATP-dependent translocase that promotes DNA strand separation and promoter escape. During the transition from initiation to promoter clearance, the kinase subunit Kin28 phosphorylates Ser-5 and Ser-7 within the Pol II carboxyl terminal domain (CTD). This phosphorylation initiates a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events on the CTD that correlates with dissociation of Pol II from the initiation machinery and its association with elongation and mRNA processing factors. This is the only general transcription factor with enzyme activity. During nucleotide excision repair, TFIIH is required for opening DNA around lesions that disrupt base pairing to permit excision of the damaged DNA and its replacement by a new DNA fragment.

The complex is recruited to target genes by interaction with DNA-bound transcriptional repressors, like MATALPHA2, MIG1, RFX1 and SKO1. The complex recruits histone deacetylases to produce a repressive chromatin structure, interacts with hypoacetylated N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 that have been programmed for repression by the action of histone deacetylases, and interferes directly with the transcriptional machinery by associating with the RNA polymerase II mediator complex. Undergoes transient hyperosmotic stress-induced SUMOylation and inclusion formation, which are important for the regulation of hyperosmotic-stress genes, for example the activation of glycerol biosynthesis genes.

EBI-2339149	DNA-directed RNA Polymerase I complex	Catalyzes the transcription of ribosomal RNA from a DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript synthesizing precursors of rRNAs.   Forms inactive dimers whereas initiation-competent Pol I is monomeric. Initiation of transcription requires the assembly of the upstream activating factor (UAF, CPX-1101), the core factor (CPX-1836), the TATA binding protein SPT15, and RNAP-I with RRN3 on the upstream element and core promoter. Upon transcription initiation, UAF, RRN3 and CF dissociate from the promoter.	The polymerase consists of a core element with a central large cleft forming the active center. The clamp element is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by an upper jaw and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it. The active-centre cleft is expanded in comparison to Pol II (CPX-2662) and the catalytic residues in the active site at the bottom of the cleft arranged such that the enzyme is trapped in an inactive conformation. A novel protein element, the `expander', exists inside the active-centre cleft, apparently stabilizing the expanded conformation of the enzyme and occluding the template DNA-binding site. Another novel, Pol I-specific protein element, the `connector', invades the active-centre cleft of a neighbouring Pol I enzyme, leading to the formation of a tightly packed Pol I homodimer. This dimer is predicted to be transcriptionally inactive because the connector and the expander both need to be released from the polymerase to allow promoter DNA loading and RNA production.

Required for DNA mismatch repair (MMR), correcting base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops resulting from DNA replication, DNA damage or from recombination events between non-identical sequences during meiosis. ATP binding  induces a conformational change in the MSH2-MSH6 (CPX-1037) and MSH2-MSH3 (CPX-1036) complexes which converts these to a clamp form that slides along the DNA and leads to recruitment of MutLalpha, MutLbeta (CPX-1667) and MLH1-MLH3 (CPX-1668). Plays a major role in maintaining the genetic stability of simple sequence repeats, by suppressing recombination between slightly divergent or homeologous DNA sequences, and in the repair of heteroduplex sites present in meiotic recombination intermediates. The MLH1-PMS1 heterodimer acts as the major Mlh heterodimer in MMR and is thought to coordinate Msh-DNA binding with downstream repair factors.	The MLH1 and PMS1 N-terminal domains associate on binding ATP, resulting in a ring-like conformation in which the associated N-terminal domains are joined to the dimerized C-terminal domains of MLH1 and PMS1, respectively, by two unstructured linkers. The N-terminal domains then dissociate from each other upon hydrolyzing ATP, which requires a divalent cation, and ADP release.	MLH1:PMS1	YMR167W	Mlh1p

Resolves the four-way Holliday junction (HJ) in which the two recombining DNAs are covalently-linked junctions in crossover formation during meiotic recombination, however, its ability to cut intact HJs was found to be very limited in comparison with other structures, suggesting that a HJ precursor (such as a nicked HJ) might be its preferred DNA substrate. In mitotic cells, the activity of MUS81-MMS4 is low during S-phase, but phosphorylation of the MMS4 leads to complex activation at the onset of mitosis by the collaborative actions of two cell cycle kinases: CDC28 (P00546) and CDC5 (P32562).

Octamers capped with CDC11polymerize end-to-end to form linear filaments that are often pairedwhilst the octamers capped with SHS1 appear to polymerize end-to-end into single filaments and/or laterally associate with each other into curved bundles or ring.	2xCDC3:2xCDC10:CDC11:2xCDC12:SHS1	YDL225W	Shs1p
EBI-2351884	Septin complex	A  heterooligomeric complex, formed from GTP-binding proteins, that polymerizes end-to-end into filaments  at the bud neck. Play a role in cytokinesis, assembling early in the cell cycle as a patch at the incipient bud site and forming a ring approximate 15 minutes before bud emergence, which transforms into an hour-glass shaped collar of cortical filaments that spans both sides of the mother-bud neck. This collar persists until just before cytokinesis, when it splits into two rings that occupy opposite sides of the neck. The septins at the bud neck serve as a structural scaffold that recruits different components involved in diverse processes at specific stages during the cell cycle.

EBI-2464701	Ku70:Ku80 complex	Single-stranded DNA-dependent 3-prime to 5-prime ATP-dependent helicase complex which binds preferentially to fork-like ends of double-stranded DNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Required for non-homologous end joining DNA double stranded break repair. Binds to naturally occurring chromosomal ends, and therefore provides chromosomal end protection. Appears to have a role in recruitment of telomerase and CDC13 to the telomere and the subsequent telomere elongation. Required also for telomere recombination to repair telomeric ends in the absence of telomerase.	Forms a dyad-symmetrical molecule with a preformed ring that encircles duplex DNA. The binding site can cradle two full turns of DNA while encircling only the central 3-4 base pairs. A broken DNA end is able to thread through the channel formed by the complex, whilst unbroken DNA cannot bind in this manner, ensuring exquisitely specific DSB recognition.

Mediates membrane fusion through the spontaneous assembly of four complementary SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) motifs. SNAREs bind to each other in-trans, that is, with SNAREs anchored in each apposed tethered membrane. The assembly process leads to a tight connection between the fusing membranes and initiates membrane fusion.	When interacting sets of SNAREs are combined, the SNARE motifs spontaneously associate to form elongated coiled coils of four intertwined, parallel alpha-helices (a SNAREpin), with each helix being provided by a different SNARE motif. The centre of the bundle contains 16 stacked layers of interacting side chains. These layers are largely hydrophobic, except for a central 0 layer that contains three highly conserved glutamine (Q) residues and one highly conserved arginine (R) residue.  SNARE motifs are classified into Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs and the hetero-oligomeric SNARE complexes that drive membrane fusion require that each parallel four-helix bundles is invariant and contains one each of the Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs.

EBI-25420492	DBF20-MOB1 kinase complex	Probable role in exit from mitosis during the cell cycle. By parology to DBF2-MOB1 kinase complex (CPX-1683), the complex once activated, translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates an unknown protein to dislodge CDC14 (Q00684) from NET1 (P47035), resulting in diffusion of CDC14 throughout the nucleus. Phosphorylates CDC14 on several sites that flank the C-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, thereby inhibiting the NLS. Because of this, phosphorylated CDC14 molecules that escape to the cytoplasm cannot efficiently return to the nucleus and dephosphorylate substrates such as CDH1 (P53197) and SWI5 (P08153). Phosphorylates chitin synthase CHS2 (P14180) to regulate cytokinesis.	This complex is paralogous to the DBF2-MOB1 kinase complex (CPX-1683) and is assumed to have the same functionality however DBF2 (P22204) accounts for the bulk of the activity, with DBF20 playing a minor role. A dbf2/dbf20 double deletion is embryonically lethal.	DBF20:MOB1	YIL106W	Mob1p

SNARE motifs are classified into Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs and the hetero-oligomeric SNARE complexes that drive membrane fusion require that each parallel four-helix bundles is invariant and contains one each of the Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. SEC9 provides both Qb and Qc SNAREpin from its N- and C-terminal SNARE domain respectively. SSO1 contains an autoinhibitory domain that can prevent premature binary SSO1-SEC9 complex assembly.

EBI-25425175	Vacuolar SNARE complex SSO1-SEC9-NYV1	SNARE complex required for the fusion of vacuoles with the plasma membrane and is active primarily in vegetative cells. Mediates membrane fusion through the spontaneous assembly of four complementary SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) motifs. SNAREs bind to each other in-trans, that is, with SNAREs anchored in each apposed tethered membrane. The assembly process leads to a tight connection between the linked membranes and initiates membrane fusion.	When interacting sets of SNAREs are combined, the SNARE motifs spontaneously associate to form elongated coiled coils of four intertwined, parallel alpha-helices (a SNAREpin), with each helix being provided by a different SNARE motif.

EBI-2639439	ATG12-ATG5 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation. Contributes to nutrition homeostasis and damage control in eukaryotic cells.   Acts as an E3-like ligase. This activity is dependent on ATP and two enzymes, ATG7 (P38862)  an E1-like activating enzyme and ATG10 (Q07879) an E2-like conjugating enzyme. Required for lipidation of ATG8 (P38182) (e.g. to phosphatidylethanolamine) and associates with the vesicle membranes once bound to ATG16 (CPX-1849).	The ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is covalently conjugated to ATG5 via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide resulting from the sequential reactions of ATG7 and the E2-like enzyme ATG10.

EBI-2639844	ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex	Essential for autophagy during nutrient deprivation, a catabolic process that sequesters undesired cellular material into autophagosomes for delivery to lysosomes for degradation.   Functions as an E3-like enzyme in the ATG8 conjugation system. The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 complex targets the autophagic membrane via the ATG5-ATG16 complex moiety and then recruits an ATG3:ATG8 thioester intermediate via the interaction between ATG3 and ATG12. The ATG12-ATG5 (CPX-1848) conjugate facilitates the transfer reaction of ATG8 from ATG3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a reorganization of the catalytic centre of the E2-like enzyme ATG3. The C-terminal glycine of ATG8 is then conjugated to the amine moiety of PE. The role of ATG16, which has no E3-like activity appears to be to target the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate to the autophagic membranes. ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 complexes form homogeneous oligomers, comprising two to four subunits. ATG16 may then act to reorganize ATG8-PE/ATG12-ATG5 oligomers to form a continuous, flat protein layer with meshwork-like architecture on membranes.	ATG12 is constitutively conjugated to ATG5, via a glycyl-lysine isopeptide. Formation of the complex is mediated by ATG16 homo-oligomerization.

EBI-2643040	Golgi SNARE complex SED5-BOS1-BET1-SEC22	SNARE complex required for fusion of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles at the cis-Golgi cisternae. Mediates membrane fusion through the spontaneous assembly of four complementary SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) motifs. SNAREs bind to each other in-trans, that is, with SNAREs anchored in each apposed tethered membrane. The assembly process leads to a tight connection between the linked membranes and initiates membrane fusion.	When interacting sets of SNAREs are combined, the SNARE motifs spontaneously associate to form elongated coiled coils of four intertwined, parallel alpha-helices (a SNAREpin), with each helix being provided by a different SNARE motif. The centre of the bundle contains 16 stacked layers of interacting side chains. These layers are largely hydrophobic, except for a central 0 layer that contains three highly conserved glutamine (Q) residues and one highly conserved arginine (R) residue. SNARE motifs are classified into Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs and the hetero-oligomeric SNARE complexes that drive membrane fusion require that each parallel four-helix bundles is invariant and contains one each of the Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs.

EBI-2927908	Vacuolar SNARE complex VAM3-VTI1-VAM7-YKT6	SNARE complex required for autophagosome-vacuole fusion. Mediates membrane fusion through the spontaneous assembly of four complementary SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) motifs. SNAREs bind to each other in-trans, that is, with SNAREs anchored in each apposed tethered membrane. The assembly process leads to a tight connection between the linked membranes and initiates membrane fusion.	When interacting sets of SNAREs are combined, the SNARE motifs spontaneously associate to form elongated coiled coils of four intertwined, parallel alpha-helices (a SNAREpin), with each helix being provided by a different SNARE motif. The centre of the bundle contains 16 stacked layers of interacting side chains. These layers are largely hydrophobic, except for a central 0 layer that contains three highly conserved glutamine (Q) residues and one highly conserved arginine (R) residue. SNARE motifs are classified into Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs and the hetero-oligomeric SNARE complexes that drive membrane fusion require that each parallel four-helix bundles is invariant and contains one each of the Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs.

EBI-3508852	Chromosomal passenger complex	Serine/threonine kinase complex which ensures chromosome bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle during metaphase by phosphorylating multiple kinetochore components. It destabilizes monopolar attachments by phosphorylating key proteins at the kinetophore. The opposing Chromosomal Passenger complex and Glc7 (P32598) activities ensure that chromosomes achieve a bipolar attachment to the spindle. Monopolar attachments do not produce tension across sister kinetochores (and the complex may act by sensing this absence of tension). The Chromosome passenger complex is conserved from yeast to man and is an essential regulator of diverse aspects of mitosis that ensure faithful chromosome segregation.  The complex undergoes changes in its localization throughout mitosis: in early mitosis it presumably localizes to chromosome arms while later in metaphase it is found at the centromere.  At anaphase onset it re-localizes to mitotic spindle microtubules accumulating in the midbody in late anaphase where it promotes spindle disassembly and cytokinesis.  In budding yeast it seems to follow the positive ends of depolimerizing microtubules in late anaphase.  It also plays a role in contractile ring formation and regulation of abscission in cytokinesis.	IPL1 binds the N-terminal domain of SLI15, while the C-terminal domain of Sli15 forms a three-helix bundle with the other two regulatory components, BIR1 and NBL1.  The size of the complex is about 1.5 MD by gel filtration indicating either elongated shape or oligomerization.	BIR1:IPL1:NBL1:SLI15	YBR156C	Sli15p

EBI-8872405	SYP1 endocytic adapter complex	Acts as a component of the machinery that drives clathrin-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast. Plays a role in the distribution of endocytic sites. Recruits Ede1 (P34216) which is important for endocytic site formation. Negatively regulates the WAS-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing of actin assembly during endocytosis. Also functions in polarized cell growth.	Crescent-shaped homodimer. Two monomers related by a two-fold symmetry axis in the crystal interact tightly to form an antiparallel dimer with an extensive buried surface area.	SYP1 dimer	YCR030C	Syp1p
EBI-8872439	Ire1 serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease complex	Endoplasmic reticulum localized, type-I transmembrane homodimer which forms in response to the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and evokes the unfolded protein response (UPR) by splicing the mRNA encoding master transcriptional regulator of the UPR,  HAC1 (P41546). IRE1 cleaves a single phosphodiester bond in each of two RNA hairpins (with non-specific base paired stems and loops of consensus sequence CNCNNGN, where N is any base) to remove an intervening intron from the target transcript. IRE1 auto-activates via transphosphorylation following binding of unfolded proteins to its N-termini.	Dimerization promotes the juxtapositioning of two cytoplasmic kinase domains in a face to face manner that facilitates trans-autophosphorylation on regulatory sites within the activation segment. Phosphorylation enables nucleotide binding which in turn enables a back-to-back dimer configuration, generating a large catalytic surface that is fully competent for ribonuclease function.

EBI-8872557	Phosphatidylinositol transporter complex	Phosphatidylinositol transfer homodimer a lipid droplet-associated protein that inhibits lipid mobilization from these particles. May assist in shuttling sterols or their intermediates, between membranes or, alternatively, between sterol biosynthetic enzymes or complexes. Required for the resistance of yeast cells to azole antifungals.	Binding of phosphatidylinositol (PI) may destabilize the homodimer causing a conversion to the monomer, possibly with PI still bound.

EBI-9009965	Myosin class V complex, MYO2 variant	Building block of the class V myosin processive molecular motor involved in a range of organelle-transporting functions, including the transport of vacuoles and mRNA. The myosin heavy chain motor domain mediates the ATP-dependent interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton. The myosin neck region with the bound light chains acts as a rigid lever arm that amplifies movements within the myosin motor domain into a large mechanical stroke that directionally propels the myosin along the actin filament. Myosin V has a high duty cycle, i.e. remains attached to actin for a large fraction of the mechanochemical cycle due to the slow rate of ADP release, the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle. This kinetic adaptation allows myosin V to take multiple steps without dissociating from the actin filament. Myosin V can take large steps of approximately 36nm, a distance equal to the helical repeat of the actin filament allowing Myosin V to walk in a straight line on the actin filament, in a hand-over-hand fashion.	MYO2 contains an N?terminal ?head? or motor domain, containing the actin?binding and ATP catalytic sites, followed by an extended ?neck? domain formed by six in?tandem IQ motifs. Following the neck is the ?tail? domain, which contains a region predicted to form a coiled?coil and a C?terminal globular domain. The IQ motifs constitute the binding sites for Ca2+?free (or apo) Calmodulin (CaM) and CaM?like light chains. IQ motifs are approximately 25 amino acids long with the consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR. Apo?CaM is the primary light chain of myosin V, occupying approximately four out of the six IQ sites, however binding of the light chain MLC1  is essential.	CMD1:MLC1:MYO2	YBR109C	Cmd1p

Apo?CaM is the primary light chain of myosin V, occupying approximately four out of the six IQ sites, however binding of the light chain MLC1  is essential.	CMD1:MLC1:MYO2	YOR326W	Myo2p
EBI-9010849	26S Proteasome complex	Multi-enzyme complex that functions as the primary degradation machinery for the selective turnover of surplus or damaged proteins within the cell. Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labeled with polyubiquitin chains which are recognized and removed by the proteasome. The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. The base drives the mechanical substrate unfolding and translocation of the unstructured polypeptides into the degradation chamber of the core peptidase. The lid contains the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) RPN11 that cleaves polyubiquitin chains from targeted substrates as an essential step in proteasomal substrate processing.	The 26S proteasome consists of one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles (RPs). The 20S proteasome core is composed of 28 subunits that are arranged in four stacked rings, resulting in a barrel-shaped structure. The two outer rings of the core are each formed by seven alpha subunits, and the two central rings are each formed by seven beta subunits. The RP is divided into the lid and base assembly intermediates. The lid comprises nine RPN subunits (RPN3/5/6/7/8/9/11/12/SEM1) and the base comprises three RPN subunits (RPN1/2/13) and six AAA+ ATPases (RPT1-6) which form a heterohexameric ring. RPN10, which consists of an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A domain and multiple C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), connects the lid and the base.

The core contains the protease active sites (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing) that perform the proteolysis reactions in an internal chamber. The regulatory particles act as a discriminating gateway for potential substrates. The base drives the mechanical substrate unfolding and translocation of the unstructured polypeptides into the degradation chamber of the core peptidase. The lid contains the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) RPN11 that cleaves polyubiquitin chains from targeted substrates as an essential step in proteasomal substrate processing.	The 26S proteasome consists of one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles (RPs). The 20S proteasome core is composed of 28 subunits that are arranged in four stacked rings, resulting in a barrel-shaped structure. The two outer rings of the core are each formed by seven alpha subunits, and the two central rings are each formed by seven beta subunits. The RP is divided into the lid and base assembly intermediates. The lid comprises nine RPN subunits (RPN3/5/6/7/8/9/11/12/SEM1) and the base comprises three RPN subunits (RPN1/2/13) and six AAA+ ATPases (RPT1-6) which form a heterohexameric ring. RPN10, which consists of an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A domain and multiple C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIM), connects the lid and the base.

EBI-9018925	COPII vesicle coat complex	Mediates formation of the membrane vesicles that export newly synthesised proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon exchange of GDP for GTP (catalysed by SEC12), SAR1 exposes an N-terminal amphipathic helix that inserts into the outer ER membrane leaflet, promoting curvature. SAR1 recruits SEC23/24 to the membrane to form the inner layer of the COPII coat. SEC24 binds transport cargo while SEC23 interacts with SAR1 and recruits the outer COPII components (SEC13/31) that form a cage around the vesicle by self-assembling into a polyhedron. SEC16 may also be required for proper COPII coat assembly but its role has not been clearly defined.	The inner and outer proteins each form lattice structures. Both coats may help to reshape the membrane, and the inner-coat and outer-coat lattices move with respect to each other. These flexible properties could allow the coat to assemble on membranes with different shapes and curvatures, forming COPII vesicles with distinct sizes and shapes that can carry a range of cargoes.

EBI-9019330	MMS2-UBC13 ubiquitin ligase complex	Ubiquitin ligase complex. Transfers the thioester-bound donor ubiquitin from Ubc13 onto the Mms2 catalytically inactive E2 variant. Functions in concert with RING E3 ubiquitin ligase RAD5 to catalyze the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of monoubiquitinated replication processivity factor PCNA (CPX-544). MMS2 positions the acceptor ubiquitin so that only Lys-63 approaches the active site cysteine of UBC13. This modification activates the recombination-like DNA damage-avoidance mechanism,  in which the replicating polymerase avoids synthesis opposite damaged DNA by transient switching of the template, from the damaged DNA strand to the intact newly synthesized strand of the sister chromatid.

EBI-9020036	Nucleosome, variant HTA1-HTB2	Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability.	1.65 tight superhelical turns of 147 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around a histone octamer to form the nucleosome core. The H3-H4 heterodimers pair to form a tetramer through interactions of a four-helix bundle (alpha2 and alpha3 of H3 from each dimer). The association of this (H3-H4)2 tetramer with DNA is the first step in nucleosome assembly. Each H2A-H2B heterodimer binds to the (H3-H4)2 tetramer via another, homologous, four-helix bundle (alpha2 and alpha3 from both H2B and H4), joining the H2B and H4 histone folds.

EBI-9022259	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3-prime end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding small structured RNAs such as tRNAs, the 7 SL lncRNA, spliceosomal U6 snRNA and ribosomal 5S RNA.   Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the  D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. RPC34, RPC31 and RPC82 play a role in transcription initiation whereas the RPC37-RPC53 heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. RPC11 is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an RPC11-dependent conformational change of Pol III.   The core complex is believed to assemble in the cytoplasm before being transported to the nucleus.	Molecular weight of = approximately 0.7 MDa.
The polymerase consists of a core element with a central large cleft forming the active center. The clamp element is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by an upper jaw and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it. The clamp head part of Pol III is enlarged compared to its Pol I (CPX-1664 ) and Pol II (CPX-2662). The depth of the DNA-binding cleft is also increased in comparison to Pol I and Pol II.

EBI-9022259	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III complex	Catalyzes the transcription of RNA from an DNA template by acting as a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3-prime end of an RNA transcript. Responsible for the transcription of genes encoding small structured RNAs such as tRNAs, the 7 SL lncRNA, spliceosomal U6 snRNA and ribosomal 5S RNA.   Pol III machinery recognizes conserved promoter elements located within the transcribed region, generally the box A and box B sequences, which contribute to the  D- and T-loops in the tRNA structure. RPC34, RPC31 and RPC82 play a role in transcription initiation whereas the RPC37-RPC53 heterodimer is crucial for the correct recognition of the termination signals of class III genes. RPC11 is required for RNA cleavage. Pol III is capable of reinitiating transcription more rapidly on the same gene after the first transcription cycle without being released (facilitated reinitiation), resulting in a higher initiation efficiency; this appears to require an RPC11-dependent conformational change of Pol III.   The core complex is believed to assemble in the cytoplasm before being transported to the nucleus.	Molecular weight of = approximately 0.7 MDa.

Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition.	Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. The fork loop 1 (RPB2) interacts with the RNA-DNA hybrid, possibly stabilizing it.	RPB2:RPB3:RPB4:RPB5:RPB7:RPB8:RPB9:RPB10:RPB11:RPC10:RPO21:RPO26	YPR187W	Rpo26p

EBI-9025983	Snf1 protein kinase complex variant SIP2	Energy sensor protein kinase complex, activated by glucose depletion. Regulates cellular energy metabolism by activating energy-producing pathways and inhibiting energy-consuming processes via derepression of glucose-repressed genes. Required for the diauxic shift, in which genes required for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (normally repressed by glucose) are switched on; growth then resumes at a lower rate. Role in filamentous invasive growth, on glucose depletion, in haploid cells.  The activity of this complex is modulated by reversible phosphorylation of SNF1 Thr-210 which increases in response to glucose starvation and correlates with large increases in cellular ADP-to-ATP and AMP-to-ATP ratios. Binding of ADP, but not AMP, to the complex protects against dephosphorylation of Thr-210, suggesting that ADP, rather than AMP, may be the critical activating signal. When glucose levels are high, the complex is cytoplasmic. Upon glucose depletion, SIP2-containing SNF1 remain in the cytosol.	A central component of the heterotrimer interface is an eight-stranded, mostly antiparallel beta-sheet, formed with four strands from SNF1 (residues 531-586), three strands from SIP2 (residues 375-412) and one strand from SNF4 (residues 38-45).

M.W.= 287 kDa. Structural studies suggest  that SEC63 tightly associates with SEC61 through interactions in cytosolic, transmembrane. SEC61 forms an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane, a plug domain in the luminal or extracellular cavity, and a lateral gate, which opens to the surrounding lipid phase. The binding of the SEC62?SEC63 complex to the SEC61 channel causes wide opening of the lateral gate. Furthermore, SEC63 optimally positions binding sites for cytosolic and luminal chaperones in the complex to enable efficient polypeptide translocation.

Acetylation of histone H4 is essential for DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination. Involved in cell cycle progression.	The structure of the NuA4 HAT complex comprises two large globular domains joined by multiple connections. One of these domains is mostly formed by TRA1. The EAF7 subunit bridges EAF5 with EAF3, a H3K36me3?binding chromodomain protein, and this EAF5/7/3 trimer is anchored to NuA4 through EAF5. TRA1 serves as a scaffold for multiprotein assemblies or as a platform for recruitment of different regulatory factors to chromatin40. Although TRA1 lacks kinase activity, it adopts a kinase-active conformation in the NuA4 complex. The EafAF1 SANT domain tightly binds to TRA1 LBE and FATC domains, which serve as scaffold for NuA4 complex assembly. The actin/ARP4 module mainly interacts with EAF1.

EBI-9648264	SPOTS complex	Serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids: condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine. The catalytic activity depends on LCB1 and LCB2, and is stimulated several-fold by TSC3. The remaining components are believed to play regulatory roles. Mature sphingolipids are an essential component of the plasma membrane. Moreover, several intermediates in sphingolipid metabolism are important signaling molecules involved in control of growth and stress response. Tight regulation of this rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis is therefore critical for lipid homeostasis, membrane biogenesis, protein quality control and trafficking through the secretory pathway. Regulation of sphingolipid synthesis is mediated by phosphorylation of ORM1 and ORM2 as well as by up-regulation of ORM2 protein levels. Sphingolipid depletion activates the TORC2 complex (CPX-1717), which triggers ORM1 and ORM2 phosphorylation by the protein kinase YPK1 (P12688). Inhibition of the nutrient-sensitive TORC1 complex (CPX-1715 /CPX-1716) triggers phosphorylation of ORM proteins by the protein kinase NPR1 (P22211). Increased phosphorylation of ORM proteins reduces their inhibitory activity resulting in stimulation of SPOTS and increased sphingolipid synthesis. In addition, the presence of the phosphoinositide phosphatase SAC1 (P32368) in the SPOTS complex appears to link sphingolipid synthesis to phosphoinositide signaling that controls ER functions and ER-to-Golgi traffic. Thus, the SPOTS complex may be responsible for coordinating sphingolipid homeostasis with a variety of processes that control cell growth and response to nutrients.

EBI-9673980	EGO complex	The EGO complex is localized to the vacuolar membranes and activates vacuolar membrane associated TORC1 in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources.  It thereby has an important role in regulating cell growth and autophagy by relaying amino acid signals.  Specifically, its subunit GTR1 becomes activated to a GTP-bound form in a downstream response to nutrient signals, causing EGO to interact with and activate TORC1.  EGO is required for recovery from rapamycin-induced growth arrest and positively regulates microautophagy.	The EGO complex is composed of 5 subunits.  MEH1 (Q02205) is N-myristoylated, which is believed to tether it to the vacuolar membrane.

EBI-9691559	Mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex	Mitochondrial matrix enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. This provides a metabolic connection between glycolysis, whose end product is pyruvate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which starts with acetyl-CoA. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity is negatively regulated via phosphorylation of its PDA1 subunit. The protein kinases PKP1 (P40530) and PKP2 (P53170) phosphorylate PDA1, and the protein phosphatases PTC5 (Q12511) and PTC6 (P25646) mediate its dephosphorylation.	Pyruvate dehydrogenase consists of five subunits that are assembled into a huge heteromultimer of 8-9 megadaltons. The core is comprised of 60 copies of LAT1 (also known as E2; dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase) that form a pentagonal dodecahedron. Twelve copies of LDD1 (also known as E3; dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) are attached to the LAT1 core via the binding protein PDX1. A variable number of PDA1 and PDB1 (also known as E1 alpha and E1 beta, respectively) subunits bind as heterotetramers to the LAT1 core. 

In the reaction mediated by the PDH complex, pyruvate becomes covalently linked to the thiamine diphosphate (TPP) cofactor of E1 (PDA1 and PDB1), creating 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP. The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (LAT1). LAT1 transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	60xLAT1:12xLPD1:24xPDA1:24xPDB1:12xPDX1	YBR221C	Pdb1p

The alpha-hydroxy group of 2-alpha-hydroxy-ethyl-TPP is subsequently oxidized, creating an acetyl group that becomes bound to the dihydrolipoyllysine group of E2 (LAT1). LAT1 transfers this acetyl group to CoA to generate acetyl-CoA.	60xLAT1:12xLPD1:24xPDA1:24xPDB1:12xPDX1	YNL071W	Lat1p
EBI-9693655	MIS complex	The MIS complex is a methyltransferase which methylates adenosine at the N6 position to form N6-methyladenosine. mRNA methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs only during meiosis. During meiosis, complete mRNA methylation requires MIS complex localization to the nucleolus in a Slz1-dependent manner. NDT80 also regulates Mum2 and Ime4 nucleolar localization during meiosis. Methylation of mRNA by this complex suppresses pseudohyphal development.	""	MUM2:IME4:SLZ1	YBR057C	Mum2p

EBI-9694296	FACT complex	A heterodimeric H2A-H2B histone chaperone, that helps reorganize nucleosomes in an ATP independent fashion. It promotes histone removal, deposition and replacement on chromatin. Due to its role in chromatin dynamics, it has a role in many cellular processes related to chromatin: DNA replication, DNA damage and repair, transcription initiation and elongation. The redundant  NHP6A/B proteins(P11632/P11633) are involved in FACT function and supply the DNA binding activity, potentially destabilizing nucleosomes to promote formation of alternative chromatin structures in addition to recruiting FACT.	FACT is an abundant complex, with about 25,000 heterodimers per haploid yeast cell, or roughly one complex per three nucleosomes.	POB3:SPT16	YGL207W	Spt16p

EBI-9696539	Core mediator complex	Plays an essential role in gene expression regulation by acting as a bridge between DNA-binding transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription machinery, serving as a central scaffold within the pre-initiation complex. The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain. The Mediator complex dissociates from the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and stays at the promoter when transcriptional elongation begins.  Reversibly associates with the CKM complex (CPX-1853). Mediator lacking the CKM complex has a stimulatory effect on basal transcription. In contrast, Mediator containing the sub-complex represses basal transcription.	Molecular weight = >1 MDa. Organized into three sub-modules, termed Head, Middle and Tail which form self-contained segments of the Mediator structure connected by relatively small interfaces. The Mediator head module contains MED6, MED8, MED11, SRB4/MED17, SRB5/MED18, SRB2/MED20 and SRB6/MED22, the middle module contains MED1, MED4,MED7, CSE2/MED9, NUT2/MED10, ROX3/MED19, SRB7/MED21 and SOH1/MED31, and the tail module contains MED2, PGD1/MED3,  NUT1/MED5, RGR1/MED14, GAL11/MED15 and SIN4/MED16.

EBI-9696539	Core mediator complex	Plays an essential role in gene expression regulation by acting as a bridge between DNA-binding transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription machinery, serving as a central scaffold within the pre-initiation complex. The Mediator complex is also targeted by sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors and appears to regulate RNAPII at both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. The Mediator complex, having a compact conformation in its free form, is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and unfolds to an extended conformation and partially surrounds RNAPII specifically interacting with the unphosphorylated form of its C-terminal domain.

The GSE complex was shown to be localized to late endosomes, and to be required for sorting of GAP1 - a general amino acid permease - to the plasma membrane from endosomes.  Regulates exit from rapamycin-induced growth arrest. GSE shares common components with the EGO complex (CPX-3172).	The GSE complex is composed of 5 subunits.  MEH1 (Q02205) is N-myristoylated, and also potentially palmitoylated. that are believed to tether it to endosomal membranes.  SLM4 (P38247) has a homodimeric structure that may assist its binding to Meh1 and its binding of the heterodimer Gtr1-Gtr2, thereby serving to dock the Gtr1-Gtr2 GTPases to MEH1 at the membrane. LTR1 (P34078) is attached to the complex via its binding to GTR1.  GTP-bound GTR1 (Q00582) and GDP-bound GTR2 (P53290) are required for GAP1 export to the plasma membrane.

EBI-9821502	SUMO activating enzyme complex	SUMO activating complex provides an E1-like activity that catalyzes the first step in conjugation of Smt3 (SUMO) to proteins (sumoylation). The activated Smt3 is then transferred to the E2-like SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9. In subsequent steps, Smt3 is covalently attached to lysine residues on target proteins by one of the E3-like SUMO ligases that include Siz1, Mms21, Cst9, and Nfi1. Attachment of Smt3 alters protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, as well as subcellular localization of the target proteins, among which are septins, several DNA repair proteins, and cell division regulators, therefore affecting chromosome segregation, cell cycle control, and likely many other regulatory pathways.	The native complex isolated from yeast cells elutes at about 128 kDa
